# Foxenger
Local chat prototype made with Python Flask

## What's this?
Foxenger is a (work in progress) small school project, made with Flask and using some Javascript and Ajax.
The main feature of this project is to create a small chatting application where an user can log in and start chatting under some username.

The project isn't meant to be secure (no password & data encryption, etc) or efficient in terms of performance as it's not the first goal of the project.
With this small project (as a Python dev), I'm starting to learn some javascript in order to improve my skills.

## What are you using to make this work?
Here is basically how the application work:
* **No (real) database.** Everything is storred for now in a json file, which is enough for this project.
* **Ajax.** Messages are fetched every few seconds with an Ajax request to the web server.
* **Javascript.** Elements are being updated with some Javascript to avoid any page refresh.

## Is this going to be a serious project?
For now, no. However, this school project is still ongoing and it's really fun to work on it! I will try to push some updates whenever I have time.

## Can I see how it looks like?
Not yet! But I'm working on bringing a live version. Once it will be publicly accessible, the link will be available here.
